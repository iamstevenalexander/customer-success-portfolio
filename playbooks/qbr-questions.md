# QBR Questions that Drive Adoption
Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) aren’t just about reporting numbers — they’re about creating alignment, uncovering opportunities, and ensuring the customer’s goals are tied to product value. These are the core questions I use to guide conversations and drive meaningful outcomes:

- **What outcome matters most this quarter?**  
  (Usually framed as a single KPI the customer would proudly show their leadership team.)

- **What’s blocking broader adoption today?**  
  (Digging into people, process, or technical barriers.)

- **Which workflows are still manual and should be automated?**  
  (Helps surface expansion opportunities.)

- **Which features did you try but pause? What would bring you back?**  
  (Reveals friction points or gaps in enablement.)

- **What’s the one thing we could do to earn a glowing renewal?**  
  (Puts the conversation squarely on value and retention.)

✅ These questions help turn QBRs into strategy sessions instead of “status updates.” They give both the customer and internal teams a clear, shared definition of success.
